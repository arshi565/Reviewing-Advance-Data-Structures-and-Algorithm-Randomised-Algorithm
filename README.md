# Reviewing-Advance-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Randomised-Algorithm
In the past few decades, randomized algorithm has seen an intense growth. The two main benefits of randomization are speed and simplicity. In regular algorithms, the output as well as the running time are functions only of the input whereas in randomized algorithm, the output or the running time are functions of the input and random bits chosen. An algorithm that uses random numbers to make up consecutive operation in the logic is called Randomized Algorithm. In a randomized algorithm the choices are made by the algorithm and the distribution of the choices is well-defined. We normally analyse such an algorithm in terms of the worst-case expected complexity.
